## Tool of the Week: **Doxxer**

> ðŸ”— https://github.com/karlis-vagalis/doxxer

The tool, `doxxer`, is a slick, command-line utility that automates Semantic Versioning (SemVer) directly from your Git tags. It's like having a personal versioning assistant that understands your commit history, so you can focus on building awesome features instead of manually bumping version numbers.

### What You Can Build With It

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automatically generate a unique, correct version number for every build, so you can easily track which commit corresponds to which release in production.  
- **Open-Source Projects**: Keep your public releases clean and consistent by generating version tags based on your commit history. No more manual `v1.2.3` tags!  
- **Package Management**: When publishing packages to registries like npm or crates.io, use doxxer to ensure every new version is a valid SemVer, preventing errors and confusion for your users.  
- **Documentation Generation**: Include the automatically generated version number in your project's documentation, giving users a clear view of the software version they are referencing.  
- **Dynamic Development Builds**: Create a pre-release version for every commit to a development branch, like `0.0.0-dev.19+1b9f41e`, making it easy to see how many commits are ahead of the last stable release.  

## Package Spotlight: **light-hooks**

> ðŸ”— https://www.npmjs.com/package/light-hooks

The library, `light-hooks`, is a lightweight, high-performance set of React hooks that provides essential functionality without the extra baggage. Itâ€™s built with modern browser APIs and TypeScript for a faster, more reliable developer experience. Think of it as a toolkit of highly optimized, single-purpose tools for common development challenges.

### What You Can Use It For

- **Build a Weather App**: Use `useGeolocation` to automatically detect a user's location and display local weather information.  
- **Create a Blog with Dark Mode**: Combine `useLocalStorage` to save a user's dark mode preference with `useIsMobile` to serve an optimized layout for phones.  
- **Make an E-commerce Site**: Implement `useDebounce` on your search bar to only fetch results once the user stops typing, saving on expensive API calls.  
- **Design an Interactive Game**: Use `useCountdown` to add a timer to a quiz or game with a time limit.  
- **Add "Click Outside" Functionality**: Use `useClickOutside` to close a dropdown menu or a modal pop-up when a user clicks anywhere else on the screen.  
- **Build a PWA**: Leverage `useFetch` for smart data fetching with built-in caching to make your Progressive Web App (PWA) feel incredibly fast, even on a flaky network connection.
