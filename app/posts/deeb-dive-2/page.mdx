## Tool of the Week: Wrkflw

> 🔗 https://github.com/bahdotsh/wrkflw

wrkflw is a terminal-based tool for validating and running GitHub Actions workflows locally. It gives you an interactive TUI for exploring, testing, and debugging workflows without having to push changes to GitHub.

### What You Can Use It For

- Quickly validate workflow syntax and catch errors before pushing.
- Run workflows locally using Docker, Podman, or native emulation.
- Debug failed jobs with preserved containers.
- Test workflow changes in a sandbox environment.

## Package Spotlight  – **VelvetIO**

> 🔗 https://github.com/hunter-arton/velvetio

VelvetIO is a sleeker, smarter Rust crate for crafting CLI tools—eliminating the slog of `stdin().read_line()` and manual parsing. It offers type-safe input, built-in validation, user-friendly errors, and even form-builder support—all with zero dependencies for lean builds.

### What You Can Build With It

- Interactive data-collection wizards — prompt users for names, numbers, confirmations, and parse everything into the correct data types effortlessly.
- Complex multi-field forms — group multiple related inputs (like username, password, email) using its form-builder feature to streamline your flow.
- Input-validated CLI tools — with smart validators and clear error messages, you can ensure users give the right kind of data (e.g. a positive integer or valid boolean).
- Lean, fast utilities — because VelvetIO is dependency-free, your binary stays compact and compiles quickly—perfect for distribution or embedded environments.
