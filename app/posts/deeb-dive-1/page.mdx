# Deeb Dive – Issue #1  

*Quick picks for indie devs.*

👋 **Hello World** – and welcome to the very first issue of *Deeb Dive*!  

This is your weekly dispatch exploring personal dev projects, indie tools, weird libraries, and the creative chaos behind building something just for yourself — or your dream that might scale to millions.

Let’s dive in. 🌊

## Tool of the Week: Fira Code

> 🔗 https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode

Fira Code is a free, monospaced font designed specifically for developers. What sets it apart? It supports programming ligatures—those fancy combined symbols like `=>`, `!=`, and `===` that render as clean, beautiful glyphs.

![Fira Code Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tonsky/FiraCode/7c5fc86cfe1e4d17778ed7100fb6bd108dc5236f/extras/logo.svg)

But Fira Code isn’t just about looking cool. It’s about improving readability, reducing cognitive load, and making it just a little easier to parse complex logic at a glance.

It works out of the box in most modern editors (VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, Vim, etc.), and it’s actively maintained with thoughtful defaults and performance in mind.

### What You Can Use It For

- Making your code more readable and easier on the eyes
- Spotting logic patterns faster with ligatures like `=>`, `<=`, `===`, `!=`, and more
- Developer tools and IDEs that need clear, readable code
- Terminal apps and CLIs with complex command outputs
- Code editors for teaching, tutorials, or live coding demos
- Documentation sites and technical blogs showcasing code snippets

## Package Spotlight  – **Sidequest.js**

> 🔗 [https://docs.sidequestjs.com/](https://docs.sidequestjs.com/)

Sidequest.js is a tiny JavaScript library that makes background tasks feel first-class. You can queue up “side quests” to run in parallel to your app’s main logic—think retries, webhooks, cron-like jobs, and API calls—without diving into full-blown infra.

### 🛠 What You Can Build With It

- **Webhook delivery with retries:** Trigger webhooks after user actions and let Sidequest handle delivery + exponential backoff.
- **Fire-and-forget API calls:** Kick off tasks like sending emails or updating third-party services without blocking the main request.
- **Scheduled jobs without cron:** Queue background tasks to run after a delay or at intervals—right from your app code.
- **Internal automations:** Use it for bots, monitoring, or back-office logic that needs async tasks without new infra.

## Built with Deeb – Flowlet

<Callout type="info">
It’s a Deeb blog — let’s talk Deeb for a sec!
Showcasing real projects built with [Deeb](/), a database for small apps and creators. Got something cool? [Share it](mailto:nickmclean@thedevoyage.com) with us!
</Callout>


> 🔗 https://github.com/The-Devoyage/flowlet

A sleek CLI tool to save, run, and sync your most-used shell commands and variables — all backed by Deeb.

Flowlet helps developers reduce friction by organizing repeat tasks into named commands, injecting variables, and syncing workflows between local and cloud environments.

### What It Does

- Save & run shell commands with variable injection
- Sync your commands to the cloud
- Extract vars from command output
- Group commands by project
- Push/pull commands to/from a Deeb server

If you’re juggling APIs, cloud scripts, or recurring setups, Flowlet keeps your terminal life tidy — and fast.

## Dive Deeper

> 🔗 [How to Build an ACID Compliant Database](/posts/how-to-build-acid)

This week, explore the inner workings of building an ACID-compliant database from scratch with Deeb. Learn how simple JSON files, Rust’s type safety, and clever transaction handling can create a reliable local database without all the usual complexity.

Perfect if you want to understand what really happens behind the scenes when data integrity matters — especially for personal or small-scale apps.

## One Last Thing

If you liked this issue, forward it to a friend who’s hacking on their own stack.

And if you’re building something weird or wonderful — [submit it here](mailto:nickmclean@thedevoyage.com) to get featured.

Thanks for diving deep,
