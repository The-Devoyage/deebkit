# The Collection Trait

The easiest and most type-safe way to work with Deeb is through the `Collection` trait. This allows you to define your data structures as Rust structs while giving you full access to Deeb’s database operations—without sacrificing compile-time safety.

If you prefer a looser, dynamic approach, check out the [Programmatic Usage Guide](/docs/guide/programtic-usage).

---

### Example

```rust
#[derive(Collection, Serialize, Deserialize)]
#[deeb(
    name = "user",
    primary_key = "id",
    associate = ("comment", "id", "user_id", "user_comment")
)]
struct User {
    id: i32,
    name: String,
    age: i32,
}
```

This defines a `User` collection backed by a JSON file and adds a relationship to a `Comment` collection. With this setup, you can immediately start performing operations like:

```rust
User::find_one(db, query, transaction)
User::find_many(db, query, find_options, transaction)
User::insert(db, document, transaction) // Use `insert_many` in v0.0.12+
User::insert_many(db, vec![documents], transaction)
User::update_one(db, query, update_doc, transaction)
User::update_many(db, query, update_doc, transaction)
User::delete_one(db, query, transaction)
User::delete_many(db, query, transaction)
```

> ⚠️ `insert` has been replaced with `insert_many` in version `v0.0.12`.

> ℹ️ `find_many` accepts an optional `FindManyOptions` struct, allowing you to skip documents, limit results, or sort by fields:
> 
> ```rust
> #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
> pub struct FindManyOptions {
>     pub skip: Option<i32>,
>     pub limit: Option<i32>,
>     pub order: Option<Vec<FindManyOrder>>,
> }
> ```

### Querying Your Data

Deeb includes a flexible query system that allows you to find documents by any field, using nested and compound logic. Learn more about how to construct powerful queries in the [Query Guide](/docs/queries).

---

### Transactions

All operations can be wrapped in transactions, allowing you to commit or roll back changes as a unit. For more info, visit the [Transactions Guide](/docs/guide/transactions).
